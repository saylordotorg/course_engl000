Course Syllabus for "ENGL000: Pre-College English"
--------------------------------------------------

Effective writing skills are important for you to succeed in your
studies at the collegiate level, as well as for your future career. This
course is designed to improve your writing ability, which is necessary
for entrance into English Composition 1, as well as for your ongoing
success in other academic subjects. Pre-College English coursework
focuses on active reading and analytic writing, with emphasis on
organization, unity, coherence, and adequate development; an
introduction to the expository essay; and a review of the rules and
conventions of standard written English. In Unit 1, you will learn the
basics of active reading and how active reading is paramount in your
success as a student and beyond. You will also learn how to identify the
main idea in a piece of literature, and how to create a topic sentence
that conveys the main idea in your own writing. You will discover the
benefits of prewriting, and will learn prewriting techniques that can be
used at the onset of any writing project. In Unit 2, you will delve
deeper into the main idea by learning the basics of thesis statements,
while developing strong thesis statements of your own. You will also
learn the value of outlines in writing, and some techniques to help you
outline effectively. Units 3 and 4 continue to explore active reading by
focusing on making inferences and paraphrasing material for use in your
own writing. Unit 5 wraps up the writing process by providing strategies
for writing introductions and conclusions. Various types of essays will
