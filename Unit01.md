**Unit 1: Active Reading** <span id="1"></span> 
*You will begin this course by reviewing the benefits of active
reading.* *Successful students—and successful readers—approach reading
with strategies to help them get the most out of their reading. These
students actively look for main ideas and major themes, words they do
not understand, and the purpose (why the piece was written) of what they
are reading. In this unit, we will cover strategies to improve your
active reading skills. Active reading will help you increase reading
comprehension and will ensure that you retain the content. This unit
will also cover creating a basic sentence and prewriting techniques to
help improve your writing.*
