**Unit 4: Transitions and Summarization** <span id="4"></span> 
*In both academic and professional writing, your goal is to convey
information clearly and concisely, if not to convert the reader to your
way of thinking. Transitions help you achieve these goals by
establishing logical connections between sentences, paragraphs, and
sections of your papers. In other words, transitions tell readers what
to do with presented information. Whether single words, quick phrases,
or full sentences, transitions function as signs for readers that tell
them how to think about, organize, and react to old and new ideas as
they read through what you have written.This unit will focus on
transitions and summarization and how to incorporate them into your
writing.*
