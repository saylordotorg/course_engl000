**Unit 2: Combining Ideas** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the previous unit you mastered different pre-writing strategies.
These strategies will help you discover information, but a paragraph
isn’t merely a list of facts. A paragraph presents your ideas about a
topic and then uses specific examples from other sources to structure
your information, develop your ideas, and support your conclusions. In
order to do this, the sentences in a paragraph must work together. When
sentences work together, the writing flows effortlessly and makes it
easier for your audience to read your work and understand the
development of your ideas. This unit will teach you how to compose
effective paragraphs. It will also discuss the power of an effective
thesis statement and will give you the information you need to create
powerful thesis statements in your own writing.*
