**Unit 5: Introductions and Conclusions** <span id="5"></span> 
*We have come full circle in our writing lessons, and now you need to
learn effective strategies to introduce and conclude your writing.
Introductions and conclusions can be the most difficult parts of papers
to write. While the body is often easier to write, it needs a frame

leave your audience with a great impression.*
