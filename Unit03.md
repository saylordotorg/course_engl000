**Unit 3: Making Inferences** <span id="3"></span> 
In this unit, you will discover the importance of *making inferences*.
Making inferences is a reading comprehension strategy that will help you
learn, remember, and apply what you have read. Another way of thinking
about making inferences is learning to *read between the lines*. In
other words, you will learn to draw conclusions from what the author has
implied. What are the relationships between the main ideas and the
subordinate ideas? Writers often convey meaning beyond the actual words.
This unit will also continue to add to your grammar knowledge by
introducing the semicolon and colon and showing how these types of
punctuation can help you to convey your points. This unit will also
discuss proofreading and enable you to read between the linesof your own
writing.
